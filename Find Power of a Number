Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.

Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        int x,n;
		Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
		x  = s.nextInt();
		n  = s.nextInt();
		int a =(int) Math.pow(x,n);
		System.out.println(a);
        
    }
}
